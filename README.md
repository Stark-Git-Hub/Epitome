# Epitome
Note Taking Web Application

Features :
- Create a new note with the preferred category.
- Edit the title & content of an existing note.
- Delete any unwanted note.
- Sort the notes based on the category or title in the alphabatical order. By default the notes are ordered by the date created.
- Search using a keyword from the required note's title.

Technologies used :
- NodeJs and Express
- MongoDB database with Mongoose
- Template was created by me

I have included the node_modules folder too. In case it doesn't work, delete it and install the dependencies using the package.json file. (Command : npm install)
